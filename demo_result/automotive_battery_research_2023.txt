==================================================
Key findings on new battery technologies in automotive industry (2023):

1. Solid-State Batteries: Emerging as a safer, higher-energy-density alternative to lithium-ion, though still in late R&D stages (Motortrend, PoweringAutos).

2. Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S): Lyten makes progress with Li-S batteries offering 2x energy density of lithium-ion and reduced reliance on critical minerals (Motortrend).

3. Sodium-Ion: Promising cost-effective alternative at half the price of lithium-ion, suitable for lower-range EVs. Being commercialized by Chinese automakers (VolvoTrucks).

4. Battery Thermal Management Systems (BTMS): Became top research focus in 2023 to optimize performance/safety. GM acquired Algolion for anomaly detection tech (EVinFocus).

5. Sustainability Trends: Push for cobalt/nickel-free designs and improved recycling processes to reduce environmental impact (MIT Tech Review, Awaken.com).

6. Industry Growth: Global investments exceed $130B in 2023, driven by EV adoption targets and renewable energy storage needs (Midtronics).

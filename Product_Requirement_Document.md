### 1.3 Business Objectives
- Reduce research time by 70% (from days to hours)
- Improve accuracy and consistency of research outputs
- Enable researchers to focus on analysis rather than information gathering
- Achieve $2M ARR within 18 months with 10,000+ monthly active users

### 1.4 Target Users
- **Primary**: Research professionals, analysts, consultants
- **Secondary**: Academic researchers, students
- **Tertiary**: Content creators, journalists, market researchers

### 1.5 Key Value Propositions
- **Time Efficiency**: Reduce research time from days to hours
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layer validation and fact-checking
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Automated multi-source information gathering
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple research projects simultaneously
- **Consistency**: Standardized research methodology and reporting

### 1.6 Success Metrics
- 95%+ accuracy in factual information
- Average research completion time under 2 hours
- 80% monthly user retention rate
- <5% monthly churn rate
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <$200 per customer
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) >$2,000 per customer
